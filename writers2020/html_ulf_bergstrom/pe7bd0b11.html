<h2>Noteringar</h2>
<p>About Greta Westerberg<br/>UB:s account:<br/><br/>Granma, Mormor :'Greta' to our English friends as known as 'momo' became 96 years of age. She was still full of energy, wits, humor and good spirits until the very last ca 2- 4 years of her long life. Her kind, humble and gentle person still strikes me as quite something. After a stroke, as well as a fall etc, ca 1997 and 1999, first you could notice that she started to have noticable problems -or rather becoming like 'ordinary' elderly people. She was a P.E. teacher all her professional life, having attended GCI , Gymnastikhogskolan, foer att se tidstypiska foton, se <a href='http://www.gih.se/templates/ihsNormalNoPanels.aspx?id=1240(then' target='_new'>www.gih.se/templates/ihsNormalNoPanels.aspx?id=1240(then</a> situated close to Gallerian/Sergels Torg, where there is a statue of that former building. For history of GCI, see <a href='http://www.gih.se/templates/ihsNormalPage.aspx?id=2052)' target='_new'>www.gih.se/templates/ihsNormalPage.aspx?id=2052)</a> And no wonder. She was always the quickest child at the playyard in Naerke. She walked 7 kilometers everyday, in each direction, to get to school. At her 90th birthday, I had her skip ropes (luckily without falling.) At her brithday 2, July, she always enjoyed being out at Ekhammer and having a fresh rose of the rose bushes from her plot of land. Also Anna Carin Lawton witnessed that 'I had the privilige of meeting your mormor more than once, and I will never forget the energy she had! At 86 years old, I saw her jump a fence rather than walk around it! '<br/><br/>She and Morfar Anders had dreamed about living at Ekhammar as retired. But Granpa died in Jan. 1968 so that never came true. I dare to say that Grandma was mortified after his death. She once told me that 'the first 14 years' were very difficult. At a time when I was ca 20, 14 years seemed a very long time. But their love story was quite exceptional. Today, it is hard to imagine two persons living each other and almost only writing long letters to each other for seven years before getting engaged. As Grandpa was a military man, he was sent to Ostersund, and thus, they were seperated for almost all the time.<br/><br/>Her long time friend Phyllis Landgren lived at nearby Nortullsgatan. Together they went out walking with the pushchairs/baby prams in Observatorielunden and became good friends. Also their daughters Elisabeth and Mum Caroline became best of friends. And it goes across generations, with their children. There is a photo now of Observatoriekullen and the blue flowers 'skilla', which she loved to see every spring, asking her self in the old age if she were to see yet one more spring of skilla in that slope, which she had done so many times.<br/><br/>Phyllis and Mormor met almost every day. Phyllis born the same year 1905 as Grannie, but 15/6, died on 20 August, 1992. I sang at the funeral in September as a last goodbye. 9 years later Granmad passed away too. So those were quite lonely years as most friends of her age had/or passed away, even if we tried to call/meet her often.<br/><br/>Grandma died on 20 July, 5 days before my daughter's birth in 2001. She had then been at hospital for ca 2 weeks, since Midsummer basically, when she was very cold. She was just recovering and they were going to send her home when she silently went away in her sleep. Mum Caroline was observing that in the middle of the night the light from Sabbatsberg hospital where she was, was alight. She was then phoned in the morning after, when she, me and aunt Barbro went there. I was out at Ekhammar, with Ewa, which Grandma enjoyed knowing. We had told her of Pamina's name-I had done that instantly when she had the stroke and she was very bad, seemed to pass away instantly, but that she later had forgotten quite understandably. And later she did not want to know it, but stick to the tradition of not knowing/keeping it a secret. But I felt that she knew it still somehow, in her mind.<br/><br/>One of the last photos of her was when Bjorn showed his youngest son David. And she suddenly beamed and made the happiest of sunshine smiles of seeing that small little young child, the youngest of her great grand children, perhaps ca 9-10 months at the time.<br/><br/>Mormor came to Stockholm in 1912 the first time, being at a cafe close to Tegelbacken, close to centralen/Sheraton, there ((Tysta Marie ?) she ate a tomato for the first time. She took a bite, but as she thought it was rotten apple, she threw it out the window.<br/><br/>She felt pretty much alone in school, the little fatherless girl, arriving from the countryside, staying in a host family, 'inackorderad'. She was not a girl of great self conficdence at the time, despite her skills. She had to be pushed by a teacher to apply to the PE university studies, albeit she was very gifted and enjoyed that a lot, being in her right element. Her elementary school friends however, later in life admitted that they were jouelous at her of her brand clothes. Somehow, her mother Hedvig always sent parcels from the top department store NK etc, with good fashion and style to her. For Grandma it was always a riddle how her mother could afford that, having only the 'restauration&quot;; i.e. head of the organisation at the 'Juno' /Gotakanal boat, for all services, as a means of income.<br/><br/>Possibly her biological father also contributed to the clothing parcels being sent to/order to Stockholm. When her father, the captain at 'Juno' of Gotakanalbatarna, <a href='http://www.gotacanal.se/SE/kanalbatarna/ms-juno/startsida.htm#' target='_new'>www.gotacanal.se/SE/kanalbatarna/ms-juno/startsida.htm#</a> was dying, he wanted to be forgiven by Granma Margareta, for having deserted the family and never having married her mother. She went to his hospital bed, but she never did forgave him. I tried to talk with grandma about this, but she was very firm on this. Having read his very affectionate letters to his daughter, with very nice writing, and knowing that he actually did contribute to her support, which Grandma acknowledged, her unforgiving stance to me always seemed quite difficult to comprehend. Of course I do not claim to know all the details, and being an child born out of wedlock was a social trauma then, in one sense. At the same time-it is important to remember that it also was very common of course to fatherless. So although he never married, and not taking full responsability for the family, he seemingly contribute at least both on occassions and reguarly to the family support.<br/><br/>Evry Christmas, Grandma made small Gingerbread houses to us Bergstrom children, decorated with cotton that we had to carry over from Observatoriegatan 5, IV floor, her house, over to Observatoriegatan 22, Mum and Dad's place, ( that had been in the family since 1934 when Grandpa Moje bought it.) Many Christmases Grannie also nitted socks in the most diverse coulours for us, which became a classic Xmas gift. She was very saddened and taken by a burglary where her jeweleries and e.g. some cartoons by her husband were stolen, ca 1975.<br/><br/>In ca late 80's/1990, she had retrieved/been given a family photo album, however she lost it/forgot it somewhere to her great dispair. Ever eager and energetic Auntie Ba' Barbro managed to get one of the tabloids to write an article about it, and make the thieves hand in their loot of the family album. To Grandma's great happiness of course.<br/><br/>Her 'mamma och pappa pa landet', i.e. mum and dad in the countryside, to whom she was very strongly tied, by, coincidence had the family name of Bergstrom, just as her second daughter;s husband Bosse. Funnily enough, some of Mormor's relatives were nominated to be the poorest in Sweden in the 50/60's. I believe the same ones that also sang on Television, so I imagine that was mainly a statistical matter. And relatively; a different kind of poorness than today. In all cases, they were spiritually very far from poor for certain.<br/><br/>Mormor attended the Baptist church in the last years of her life, and I think she even belonged to that church from her child. She was sincerly religious, without being demanding or condeming about it to others who were not devout Christians. It was just a matter of life.<br/><br/>Her childhood, Hjortkvarn, Odland, Tjaellmo och Narke were places to which she always longed to somehow, in her heart for sure.. ' <a href='http://www.svenskgeografi.se/laen/oerebro/50270-kaengstorp.html' target='_new'>www.svenskgeografi.se/laen/oerebro/50270-kaengstorp.html</a><br/><br/>Kängstorp, Hjortkvarn, Pålsboda, Örmon, Örmohult, var platser som Mormor Greta alltid talade om och längtade till....till hallonfallen där, för att göra oslagbar hallonsylt och hallonsaft.<br/><br/>Hallonfallen: the stories of the seemingly endless raspberry bushes and being a place where picking went on for hours. You just had to turnaround and they, at least in my ears, sounded as if they were big as trees.Her Raspberry lemonade 'hallonsaft' was outstanding....a child hodd classic! Even as small icecubes.The only equivalent is the one I was given by one of her younger relatives, Chris Joge from the area. Grannie was very happy when we twice went there in the late 1990's. Since she could not drive her own VW 68 in almost mint condition, because of limited visual abilities she felt a bit limited, and theat her freedom was reined in. My cousin Hans later bought her car. When we went there, Grannie was very practical, and down to earth when we went there, and she specified clearly that we should buy half a kilo of coffee to the ones we were visiting, which was the way it was before, in the old days. No sweet chocolates here, the usefuleness was in her blood, as was the ever careful with money, without being parsimonious, but generous with her love to her surroundings.<br/><br/>Grannie was not very keen on cooking, but for me, my brother Björn who were taken care of part time by her, (as well as our sister who however were in school and older) and she enjoyed making bullar 'buns' and making cookies, as well as in particular dry 'skorpor', but also 'drömmar'. Otherwise, I recall it as being rice, cucumber and meatballs, well virtually,everyday. And why not for a child? She often accompanied us to Observatorielunden back and forth, and later to school, 'Lilla Adolf Fredrik.'<br/><br/>As for herself, however, she hardly ate at all. I would claim that she basically was living on very little, in principle, tea and white bread, possibly some butter and marmelade. Every day. That was it. Hardly a complete 'circle of nutrion and vitamins. But when she invited us over for dinner, it was never a risk having to leave the table hungry. It was the old style manner of generosity. Nothing spared. And she was very insistant on everyone taking extra rounds. She used to serve e.g. konserverade päron med glass till efterätt, och bjöd ofta på lax på middagar för oss.<br/><br/>Mormor was 'old school'. I remember that I was told off as 5 year old not to say 'himla' bra..heavenly good. I asked why? and explained that it was related to searing but I was not quite convinced, and I think she herself felt that the offence was quite mild. There was neither any punishment of course.<br/><br/>Another story on the same old style school of Grannie was when my brother Bjorn had a friend who was passing by to help out with a TV, or something, in her apartment, in the ca mid 90's, as he was lending the apartement during the summer I believe? Grandma did not know of this friend passing by and Bjorn was out for some reason. As the firend George, went out into the kitchen, for a glass of water, suddenly George, was absolutely dead frozen out of fear, as he heard a most severe, demanding, inquisatory, and most sinister and sceptical voice, asking him &quot;Who are you and what are you doing in my kitchen?&quot; This demand from this seemingly old, and fraglie little grandma did not impede her from having a strong sense of integrity and standing up for her rights...So she still had the guts and spritis very high up in her ages.<br/><br/>Grandma had a sausage dog, 'Tuss' in the 60's, (?) Tusse/ This also inspired the names of the sausage dogs of the Wendt family, 'Tasse', et al...along that line of names.<br/><br/>I would say that till the very end of her life, she was always a small town girl, who however had lived in the city for almost all her life. She always longed back to her childhood plains, although that time and place did not exists as it was then. I imagine that kind of nostalgia is what we all carry with us. The past that no longer us, apart from within ourselves. Instantly her eyes went soft when hearing the names of Tjaellmo, Hjortkvarn, Hallsberg, Borensberg and Ljusfallshammar.\<br/><br/>Pls add your memories and accounts below!:<br/><br/>/Ulf Bergström, dotterson</p>
